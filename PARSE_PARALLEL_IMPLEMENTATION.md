# Parse-Parallel Implementation Summary

## âœ… Implementation Complete

### Key Changes:

1. **LikedMeals Component** (`/src/components/LikedMeals.tsx`):
   - Parse-parallel is triggered **immediately** when user clicks "Start Cooking This Recipe" (line 341-434)
   - Runs in background while user navigates
   - Stores result in localStorage: `parsed_recipe_${meal.id}`

2. **Cook Page** (`/src/app/cook/[mealId]/page.tsx`):
   - **REMOVED** duplicate parse-parallel code
   - No longer makes API calls (line 380)

3. **Steps Page** (`/src/app/cook/[mealId]/steps/page.tsx`):
   - **NO API CALLS** - only reads from localStorage
   - Checks localStorage first for pre-parsed data
   - Falls back to basic single-track graph if no cached data
   - Never makes parse-parallel API calls

## Flow Diagram:

```
1. User clicks "Start Cooking This Recipe" in LikedMeals
   â†“
2. triggerParseParallel() starts immediately (background)
   â†“
3. User navigates to cook page (no waiting)
   â†“
4. Parse completes â†’ stores in localStorage
   â†“
5. User reaches steps page
   â†“
6. Steps page reads from localStorage (no API call)
```

## Benefits:

- âš¡ **Early Processing**: Parse starts at the earliest possible moment
- ðŸš€ **Non-blocking**: User experience is never blocked
- ðŸ’¾ **Efficient**: Steps page only reads from cache, never calls API
- ðŸ”„ **No Duplicates**: Parse-parallel is called exactly once per recipe

## localStorage Key Format:
```javascript
`parsed_recipe_${mealId}`
```

## Stored Data Structure:
```javascript
{
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  graph: StepGraph,
  annotations: Annotations,
  recipe: ParsedRecipe
}
```

## Console Logs to Verify:

### In LikedMeals:
- "ðŸ”„ [LikedMeals] Triggering background parse-parallel for recipe"
- "âœ… [LikedMeals] Background parse-parallel successful"
- "ðŸ’¾ [LikedMeals] Stored parsed recipe in localStorage"

### In Steps Page:
- "Steps page - Using pre-parsed graph from localStorage"
- "Steps page - No pre-parsed data found, using fallback single-track graph"

## Testing:

1. Open DevTools â†’ Network tab
2. Click "Start Cooking This Recipe" in LikedMeals
3. Verify parse-parallel API call happens immediately
4. Navigate to steps page
5. Verify NO additional parse-parallel API calls
6. Check localStorage for `parsed_recipe_${mealId}` key
